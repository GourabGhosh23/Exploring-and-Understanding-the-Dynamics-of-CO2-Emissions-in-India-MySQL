# Exploring-and-Understanding-the-Dynamics-of-CO2-Emissions-in-India-MySQL  

**Description:**  

This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of CO2 emissions in India over the years, aiming to unravel the underlying trends and factors contributing to the observed patterns. The exploration encompasses various dimensions, including total CO2 emissions, per capita emissions, population growth, and the composition of CO2 emissions from different sources. Additionally, the project investigates the top years with the highest emissions, scrutinizes the types of emissions, and assesses the share of each emission type over time.

The findings highlight a consistent increase in both total and per capita CO2 emissions in India since 1970, raising concerns about the nation's environmental impact. The examination of population growth reveals a noteworthy decrease in growth percentage since 2000. The project also sheds light on the dominance of coal in contributing to CO2 emissions, despite observable shifts in the share of oil and gas emissions in recent years.

Furthermore, the project examines the top years with the highest CO2 emissions and per capita emissions, emphasizing the urgency of addressing this escalating issue. The analysis extends to explore the changing composition of CO2 emissions, notably the decreasing percentage of temperature increase in recent years. The project provides insights into the complexities of India's energy consumption and its role in CO2 emissions.

In summary, this project offers a nuanced understanding of the interplay between population growth, energy consumption, and various types of CO2 emissions in India. The insights gained aim to contribute to informed discussions and strategies for sustainable environmental practices in the country.
